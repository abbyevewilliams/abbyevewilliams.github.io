I'm passionate about science communication and outreach. I currently work with [The Brilliant Club](https://thebrilliantclub.org/), a UK-based charity which links PhD researchers with local non-selective schools. As part of this I teach a course on evolutionary biology to young people aged 14-16. If you have any questions about working with The Brilliant Club, feel free to get in touch.
