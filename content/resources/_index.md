**Code**

I use a mixture of open-source tools and custom pipelines for bioinformatics analyses. Workflow management tools such as [Snakemake](https://snakemake.github.io/) and [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) are great for reproducibility and I try to use these as much as possible in my research. The pipelines I've built myself are available on my [github](https://github/abbyevewilliams) and you can have a look at my starred repositories to see some of my favourite existing workflows.

**Books**

* *Statistical Rethinking* by Richard McElreath.
  Great explanations of key concepts in statistics. See also the [youtube series.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdnMWdICdRs)
* *Superior: The Return of Race Science* by Angela Saini.
  An important read for anyone studying evolutionary biology/genetics.

**Website template**

I used the [Hugo Academic CV template](https://docs.hugoblox.com/tutorial/resume/) to create this website.
