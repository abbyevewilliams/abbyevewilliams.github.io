Below are some resources that I've found useful. I hope you do too!

**Books**
* *Statistical Rethinking* by Richard McElreath.
  See also the [youtube series.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdnMWdICdRs)
* *Superior: The Return of Race Science* by Angela Saini.
  An important read for anyone studying evolutionary biology/genetics.
