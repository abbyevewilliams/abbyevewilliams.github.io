A few things that have been helpful for me so far!

**Bioinformatics**

As part of my PhD I've been learning how to analyse genomic data. Below I've listed a few things below that have been helpful for me.
* [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCd6B5HRaZ8) is a useful introduction to the process of DNA sequencing.
* It's useful to get comfortable with the command line for any kind of genomics or 'big data' project, as this is the main way you interact with the HPC (high performance cluster). There are loads of courses online, e.g. [codeacademy.](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line)
* Pipeline management tools such as [Snakemake](https://snakemake.github.io/) and [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) allow you to make your workflows more streamlined and reproducible. There are loads of pre-designed workflows out there, e.g.
  * [nf-polish](https://github.com/MozesBlom/nf-polish) for cleaning DNA from avian museum samples.
  * [PopGLen](https://github.com/zjnolen/PopGLen/tree/master/config) for doing population genomics analyses on mixed museum and contemporary samples.

**Books**

* *Statistical Rethinking* by Richard McElreath.
  See also the [youtube series.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdnMWdICdRs)
* *Superior: The Return of Race Science* by Angela Saini.
  An important read for anyone studying evolutionary biology/genetics.

I used the [Hugo Academic CV template](https://docs.hugoblox.com/tutorial/resume/) to create this website.
