I'm a PhD student at the University of Oxford, UK, studying bird evolution in [Sonya Clegg's](https://egioxford.web.ox.ac.uk/clegg-group) group at the [Edward Grey Institute for Field Ornithology](https://egioxford.web.ox.ac.uk/home). I am interested in using genomics as a tool to understand evolutionary processes such as adaptation, hybridisation and extinction.

Previously, I worked as a Research Assistant at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, Panama and the University of Cambridge, UK, studying butterfly wing pattern evolution and tropical forest conservation.

I'm always happy to chat - feel free to get in touch!
