**Code**

I use a mixture of open-source tools and custom pipelines for bioinformatics analyses. Workflow management tools such as [Snakemake](https://snakemake.github.io/) and [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) are great for reproducibility and I try to use these as much as possible in my research. The pipelines I've built myself are available on my [github](https://github/abbyevewilliams) and you can have a look at my starred repositories to see some of my favourite existing workflows.

**Website template**

I used the [Hugo Academic CV template](https://docs.hugoblox.com/tutorial/resume/) to create this website.
